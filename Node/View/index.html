<center><p><strong>Brief how I reflection on debugged asynchronous issues.</strong>
    <br>When debugging asynchronous issues, the process generally involves the following steps:

    Identify the Problem: Start by recognizing the symptoms, such as data not being loaded <br>correctly, or code that runs out of order. Common signs include missing data, undefined values, or errors related to promises not resolving as expected.
    
    Check Promise Chains and Async/Await Usage: Ensure that .then(), .catch(), and .finally() <br>methods are correctly chaining. If using async/await, verify that the code waits for promises to resolve with await. For example, missing await <br>might lead to attempts to access data before it's available.
    
    Inspect Network Calls: Use browser developer tools (like the Network tab) to see if the <br>network requests are being made correctly, and check the status codes. A failed request can lead to unexpected issues, so it's essential to ensure successful responses.
    
    Log Intermediate Results: Adding console.log statements at different points in the code can <br>help determine where things are going wrong. For instance, logging the response before parsing it with .json() can show if the issue lies in <br>the request itself or the parsing.
    
    Error Handling: Confirm that errors are being caught properly with .catch() or try/catch blocks. <br>Unexpected errors can disrupt the flow of async code, so having clear error messages can help pinpoint where the issue is.
    
    Use Debuggers: Sometimes, stepping through the code line by line with a debugger can reveal the exact <br>point where the flow goes wrong, especially for asynchronous operations. This can be done in browser developer tools or within IDEs that support debugging.
    
    By following these steps, it's easier to pinpoint and resolve issues related to promises, async/await behavior, <br>and unexpected results from asynchronous calls.</p></center>
